# DOM BlackJack

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Apesosmarc/Updatedblackjackgame/main/images/blackjackSS.png"/></p>

**A blackjack game made using only HTML/CSS/JS, animated using 3d CSS transitions and effects**

## Tech Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

This project expanded on a simple text-based blackjack game I created in a REPL for my vanilla JS AltCademy project. Now fully visually and responsive, hence Updatedblackjackgame.

## Notable Features:
* Clean, structured DOM selectors and functions accurately named based on what they do.
* Inspired by OOP Single Responsibility Principle. ie; DOM functions seperate from game loop functions.
* Async JS used to create animation delays, and "wait" for CSS styles to be played.
* Visual card flips using exciting 3D CSS animations.
* Responsive across all view widths and modern mobile devices.

## Vision/Goals For This App:
* To create a visual experience using pure HTML/CSS/JS, without the use of libraries or frameworks.
* To apply SOLID OOP design principles.
* Use Array methods, nested loops and basic JS tools to apply card-counting logic.
* Replicate an almost 'flash-like' card game that users can play within browser.
